            <li>What is the difference between a web server and a web container? </li>
            <ul><li>Web server listens to requests from clients and provides a response.
             Web container,however, manages the components such as Servlets</li></ul>
            <li>What is a servlet?</li>
            <ul><li>Servlet is a server side program which processes requests according to the requirements.</li></ul>
            <li>How do web servers and web containers interact with servlets?</li>
            <ul><li>Web server receives a request, web container passes the request to the
              servlet after consulting the web descriptor</li></ul>
            <li>Who creates request objects?</li>
            <ul><li>Servlet container</li></ul>
            
            <li>What are the states in the servlet lifecycle?</li>
            <ul><li>First, servlet class is loaded followed by instanitiation. Then,
                the servlet calls service() method to process client's request before it is
                terminated and garbage collected by JVM garbage collector</li></ul>
            <li>Who calls init and when?</li>
            <ul><li>By the servlet container and it is called once at the beginning of client's request</li></ul>
            <li>Which of init, service, and doGet should you override?</li>
            <ul><li>service and doGet</li></ul>
            <li>In what sense are servlets multi-threaded?</li>
            <ul><li>The servlet container creates multi-thread where each thread
                excutes the service() method of a signle instance of servlet</li></ul>
            <li>What are the implications of this for servlet instance variables?</li>
            <ul><li>Poor implementation may lead to threadlocks</li></ul>
