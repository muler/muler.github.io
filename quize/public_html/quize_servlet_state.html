            <li>Can post requests be bookmarked? What are the problems? </li>
            <ul><li>No, they cannot mainly because all the form parameters will be lost</li></ul>
            <li>What is the purpose of request dispatching?</li>
            <ul><li>It receives requests from the client and sends them to any resource on the same server.</li></ul>
            <li>What is the difference between redirect and request dispatch?</li>
            <ul><li>In redirect, control can be redirect to resources to different servers or domains whereas using 
                request dispatch, control can be forward to resources available within the server from where the call is made.</li></ul>
            <li>What is an attribute ?</li>
            <ul><li>An attribute is one that enables servlets to share information among themselves </li></ul>
            
            <li>What is the difference between attributes and parameters?</li>
            <ul><li>Both enables to share informations sharing among servlets. However, parameters are read only whereas the 
                attributes could be created, added, or removed.</li></ul>
            <li>What are dangers of using attributes?</li>
            <ul><li>It could lead to sharing sensitive information.</li></ul>
            <li>What does it mean to say that http is stateless? Give an example of a stateful protocol.</li>
            <ul><li>Http is stateless in the sense that once the request processing the complete, the parameter values are lost.
                TCP protocol is stateful protocol.</li></ul>
            <li>Give 5 different methods for maintaining state information (count each attribute scope as one method).</li>
            <ul><li>request object, session object, application object, cookies, hidden form</li></ul>
            <li>How long does a session last?</li>
            <ul><li>For as long as the session timeout</li></ul>
            <li>What is a cookie, and how long does a cookie last?</li>
            <ul><li>Cookie is a text file stored on the client. Session cookies last for as long as the browser is open and persistent 
                cookies last for as long as the maximum age.</li></ul>
            <li> What is the purpose of URL rewriting?</li>
            <ul><li>To alter the parameter values in the URL</li></ul>
            <li> Why does the request attribute report ‘null’ for the maintaining state demo?</li>
            <ul><li>If the request attribute reports null, that means that the request processing is complete and 
                any second attempt to retain the value leads to null.</li></ul>
