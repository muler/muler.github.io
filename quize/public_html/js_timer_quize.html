            <li>What is the differencebetween the following 2 statements?setTimeout(booyah, 2000);setTimeout(booyah(), 2000); </li>
            <ul><li>The first one calls booyah after 2s whereas in the second, the function booyah() is called immediately rather than waiting for 2 seconds</li></ul>
            <li>What do the following 2 alerts display (answer without running the code)?
                var myfunc = function(a, x) {return a * x;};<br>
                var x = myfunc(2, 3);<br>
                var y = myfunc;
                alert(x);
                alert(y(2,3));</li>
            <ul><li>Both display a window alert with value 6 on it</li></ul>
            <li>Write functions booyah1 and booyah2 so that in both cases below, an alert box comes up after 2 seconds that says “BOOYAH!”
                <br> setTimeout(booyah1, 2000);<br>setTimeout(booyah2(), 2000);</li>
            <pre>
                for the first one:
                   function booyah1() {
                     alert("BOOYAH!");
                  } 

                for the second one:
                  function booyah2() {   
                    return booyah1;
                  } 
            </pre>


            <li>What is "Unobtrusive Javascript"? What is the practical application of Unobtrusive Javascript (and the reasons for using it)?</li>
            <ul><li>It is the best practice to separate the content of the web page from the behaviour or functionality. It fascilitates maintenability
                    and quick error fixes.</li></ul>
